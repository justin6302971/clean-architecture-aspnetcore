# Clean Architecture For dot net core application
TBD

## Technologies
TBD

## Background
TBD
N-tiers layers,repository pattern, dependency injection, seperation of concerns

## Purposes
create a sample clean architecture application without MediatR libration and repository patterns

## important Trade-off
have to recreate interfaces for dbcontext to follow the clean architecture project structure and principles
1. [Make IDbContext](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/16470)
2. [Resolve your DbContext as an interface](https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/resolve-dbcontext-as-interface-in-aspnet5-ioc-container/)
